Chrome browser addon GDS - Google Dataset Search Chrome omnibox redirect. 

<pre>
I wrote this in order to quickly access Google Dataset Search directly from Chrome's omnibox. 
<p>
Directions for use, install the addon. Once GDS is installed type gds into Chrome's omnibox. Then depress your tab key once.
<p>
Now, all you have to do is type your Google Dataset search query into the omnibox and depress the enter / return key. Your
<p>
Google Dataset Query will be submitted and loaded into the current tab. Through this together for data scientists
<p>
or anyone who wants to quickly access Google's Dataset Search and preserve Chrome's default search engine. Most of the code
<p>
was culled from https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index . 26 lines of code, I hope some may find it useful. For those 
<p>     
with an interest in data science and data visualization Google's Dataset Search  https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ and R 
<p>
Studio Cloud <sup>beta</sup>   https://rstudio.cloud/ are great resources to explore and learn from. This small contribution is 
<p>     
completely opensource under the MIT and BSD Licenses. Installation, simply download the 
<a href="https://github.com/dev-tek/GDS/blob/master/GDS.crx?raw=true">GDS.crx</a> file or drop the relevant source files into an empty dir and from the 
<p>     
extensions tab while in developer mode utilize the load unpacked feature and select the directory you dropped the sources into.

Enjoy!
