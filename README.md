# GDS
Chrome browser addon GDS - Google Dataset Search Chrome omnibox redirect. 
<p>
I wrote this in order to quickly access Google Dataset Search directly from Chrome's omnibox. 
<p>
Directions for use, install the addon. Once GDS is installed type gds into Chrome's omnibox. Then depress your tab key once.
<p>
Now all you have to do is type your Google Dataset search query into the omnibox and depress the enter / return key. Your
<p>
Google Dataset Query will be submitted and loaded into the current tab. Through this together for data scientists
</p>
or anyone who wants to quickly access Google's Dataset Search and preserve Chrome's default search engine.
