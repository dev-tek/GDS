Chrome browser extension GDS - Google Dataset Search Chrome omnibox redirect. 

<pre>
I wrote this in order to quickly access Google Dataset Search directly from Chrome's omnibox. 

Directions for use, install the extension. Once GDS is installed type gds into Chrome's omnibox. Then depress your tab key once.

Now, all you have to do is type your Google Dataset search query into the omnibox and depress the enter / return key. Your

Google Dataset Query will be submitted and loaded into the current tab. Threw this together for data scientists

or anyone who wants to quickly access Google's Dataset Search and preserve Chrome's default search engine. Most of the code

was culled from https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index . 26 lines of code, I hope some may find it useful. For those 
     
with an interest in data science and data visualization Google's Dataset Search  https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ and 

R Studio Cloud <sup>beta</sup>   https://rstudio.cloud/ are great resources to explore and learn from. This small contribution is 
  
completely opensource under the MIT and BSD Licenses. Installation, simply download the <a href="https://github.com/dev-

tek/GDS/blob/master/GDS.crx?raw=true">GDS.crx</a> file or drop the relevant source files into an empty dir and from the 
   
extensions tab while in developer mode utilize the load unpacked feature and select the directory you dropped the sources into. 
  
Enjoy!
